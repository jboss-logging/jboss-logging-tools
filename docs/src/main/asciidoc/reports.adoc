== Reports

There are currently two types of reports that can be generated. The options are `adoc` for asciidoc and `xml` for XML.

The reports contain the following data:

* The formatted message id.
* A possible link to a resolution document for the error.
* The unformatted message.
* The log level, if applicable.
* The return type, if applicable.

=== Annotations

Two annotations can be used to assist withing linking resolution documents for messages.

* link:{javadocsdir}[`@BaseUrl`]
  - This annotation can be used on a type to define the base URL for linking resolution documents. This annotation is
    not required for links to be created on reports.
* link:{javadocsdir}[`@ResolutionDoc`]
  - This annotation is used to define information about the resolution document for creating links. If placed on an
    interface all methods that have a defined id will have a link generated. This can also be placed individually on
    the method to only generate links for specific id's.
